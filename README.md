BLE MIDI for Android
====================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/kshoji/BLE-MIDI-for-Android.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.com/kshoji/BLE-MIDI-for-Android)

MIDI over Bluetooth LE driver for Android 4.4 (API Level 19) or later

- Protocol compatible with [Apple Bluetooth Low Energy MIDI Specification](https://developer.apple.com/bluetooth/Apple-Bluetooth-Low-Energy-MIDI-Specification.pdf).
    - The app can be connected with iOS devices.
- BLE Central function
    - `Central` means `BLE MIDI Device's client`.
    - The specification needs `Bluetooth Bonding(Pairing)` feature that is implemented at Android KitKat(API Level 19), so this library also needs `API Level 19`.
- BLE Peripheral function
    - `Peripheral` means `BLE MIDI Device`.
    - The Peripheral function is introduced at `API Level 21`. 
    - Currently, the bonding feature is not implemented.

------------

- BLE Central function needs:
    - Bluetooth LE(4.0) support
